## Introduction
CapGPT is a project built from a grandiose desire to add entropy to the universe, as well as an interest in trying out new, different technologies. By simply asking CapGPT a question, you can be sure to receive a high-quality, completely false response.

For those of us who enjoy being "the rock in someone's shoe," or for those who simply want to get a quick chuckle (or a quick exhale through the nose), CapGPT fulfills a unique niche in the Machine Learning ecosystem: playful misinformation.

## Features
- Top-of-the-line, mostly harmless misinformation
